6. Keras

## Things learned and explored in this file:
1. Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Adding layers in DL algorithm, and using Sequential API in particular
3. Model Compilation- Learning RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation) as an Optimizer to reduce loss function
4. Model Evaluation
5. Hyperparameter Tuning (including learning rate, epoch, and batch)
