# Deep-learning-using-Boston-Housing-dataset
## Frameworks Used:
1. SciKit Learn
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Tensorflow
6. Keras

## Things learned and explored in this file:
1. Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Adding layers in DL algorithm, and using Sequential API in particular
3. Model Compilation- Learning RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation) as an Optimizer to reduce loss function
4. Model Evaluation
5. Hyperparameter Tuning (including learning rate, epoch, and batch)

## Readability Issues Fix:
Github is unable to render the Python files properly. To view it properly you can either click on Housing Dataset file.ipynb and click Open on Colab or click here at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rayan-roy/Deep-learning-using-Boston-Housing-dataset/blob/master/Housing%20dataset%20file.ipynb. The nbviewer allows the user to view python files correctly.
